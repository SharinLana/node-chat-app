# Real Time Chat App

> This Chat App allows you to exchange messages in sync with other people in real time and keep your conversation private by creating a specific room to chat in. Users from other rooms does not have access to your room and can't see your messages.
> To start using the application, you need to set your username and create a name of the room. For example, name: Lucy, room: JavaScript. Your interlocutors should type in the same room name when entering the application to join the chat.

## The goals of creating this application:

The main goals for me as a web developer were to improve my skills in working with:

- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Socket.io
- Mustache.js library
- Moment.js library
- Qs library
- HTML/CSS

- profanity checking (messages with swear words will not be published)
- displaying the timestamp for each message
- displaying the user's name for each message
